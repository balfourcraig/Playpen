			<h1>Bullshit Names in Software</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>This has bugged me for a while, though it's hard to nail down exactly where the issue is. It's also such a seemingly minor thing that it seems stupid to even write about, yet here we are. I am talking about the stupid names which are so trendy in modern software. The two "ecosystems" (another pretentious term) I've seen most afflicted by this are Python and JS, more specifically npm. I could write a whole article on npm, and perhaps I will, but I'll just talk about the bullshit names for now. That's not to say they're to only ones with stupid naming (Ruby's "Gems" come to mind) but they do seem to encourage it.</p>
			
			<p>Take Python for example, a language which has it's uses (not nearly as wide as its fans would have you use) but jeeze if it's package names don't make me want to never speak to a Pythonister or Pythoneer again! Seemingly every library has a "quirky" name, and I hate them all. Here's some examples, I've included what they do, because the names tell you fuck all:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Pandas - A data analysis library</li>
				<li>Pickle - This one is part of the standard library for serialization</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Far too many packages which should have sensible names opt for stupid ones, and it just makes everyone's lives more difficult for the same of some hipster feeling quirk.</p>
			<p>And don't get me started on all the names ending in "er" with the "e" omitted...</p>
