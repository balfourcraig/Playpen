			<p>This is my site. There are many like it, but this one is mine.</p>
			<p>Very much a work in progress, and mostly just a scratchpad for me to put random shit up somewhere. The styling is pretty nasty, but I like it and I was tired of every website looking exactly the same with flat colours and  grey-on-white. Let's bring some much needed funk back to the internet!</p>
			<hr>
			<p>The cool stuff is under <a href="ramblings.html">Deranged Ramblings</a>, so check that out first. It's mostly ideas I come up with and want to test out. It's also a way to experiment with and get better at JS</p>
